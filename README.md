# auto-editor
This is an python module which is responsible for editing together a video file based upon the relevant timestamps extracted using OCR from the video itselt

## How to Setup
To run the script you're going to need to configure a few variables. In order to run the script we need to simply follow the steps listed below:

1. Create an anaconda/miniconda environment called auto-editor and install all the requirements listed in the requirements.txt file. If you have not done this yet execute the following code inside this directory:
```
conda create --name auto-editor python=3.13.7
conda activate auto-editor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure that the CONDA_SCRIPTS variable in run_script.bat file mentions the directory of where the Anaconda Scripts folder is located correctly.

3. Have fun downloading and editting streams with the code!
